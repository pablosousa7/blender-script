Simple plugin to move between collections within blender

This first function moves all objects between collections, you have to pass 3 arguments

moveAllObjectsAnotherCollection(cFrom, cTo, stayObjs)

cFrom = collection from which objects will be extracted
cTo = collection where new objects will be stored
stayObjs = if you want to keep the objects in the original collection or remove them.


the second function does the same thing, but you can only move one file at a time.
